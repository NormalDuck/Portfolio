    <h1>My Journey of programming:</h1>
    <p>
      I started programming when I was a kid in 3rd grade. Where my teacher
      showed me how to use <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/"> scratch</a>.
      Seeing how I can communicate with computers makes me become intrested in
      computer science. I started making games, remixes, learning the fundament
      of programming, how to use variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've always been wondering how Roblox games work. But I had a shitty
      laptop that couldn't function properly. Always causing lag where I
      couldn't learn anything off of it. Until around July 15, 2023. I finally
      got a better laptop where I can offically start learning Roblox studio.

        This plugin syncs your code to
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> which
        allows external editing without opening studio.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>
        /
        <a href="https://github.com/">Github:</a>
        I use these tools with the basic features, Such as uploading files to
        github. I don't really use git, nor version controlling. I just store my
        code to github to make it easier for me. However I havent mastered this
        tool and I can tell you I cannot collaborate with others in github. I
        can't do branches

        >
        I only understand the basics of React, Basically I cannot do anything
        advanced with React. I have created some ui but eventually gave up
        learning this. I might relearn react later when I have time tho.
